# Linear Regression from Scratch

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of Linear Regression from scratch using Python, without relying on popular machine learning libraries like scikit-learn. The purpose of this project is to build a deeper understanding of the mathematics behind Linear Regression, including gradient descent and loss function optimization.

## Features
- Implementation of Linear Regression without external ML libraries.
- Uses Gradient Descent to optimize the cost function.
- Supports single-variable and multi-variable linear regression.
- Visualizes the fitted line against the data points.
- Calculates accuracy metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
